# VUE.js Cheatsheet

## Vue Instance:

This controls the part(s) of our application

A vue instance is created with 

```
new Vue(
  {
    //JS Object
  }
);
```

We generally have a single 'root' vue instance, in single page application.

- In the root instance, we manage the hierarchy of components.
- Components can be called on demand by a user action - generally a URL.

We load our root component in the HTML page inside an HTML tag. I prefer a <div> tag with an html ID.


In the index.html:
```
  <body>
    <noscript>
      <strong>We're sorry but <%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %> doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.</strong>
    </noscript>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- built files will be auto injected -->
  </body>
```
In the root component:
```
new Vue(
  {
    el: '#vue-app',
    data: {

    }
  }
)
```
or in main.js:
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import VueResource from 'vue-resource'

Vue.use(VueResource);

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

## Data and Function bindings (in Vue component):

In the root component we can define several things like data and methods inside the single JS object like this:
```
new Vue(
  {
    el: '#vue-app',
    data: {
      var1: 10
    },
    methods: {
      greet: function(name) {
        return 'Good morning ' + name;
      }
    }
  }
)
```

The data can be bound with  `{{}}` and methods can be called as usual like greet('Ashish'),  in the html page.

We can bind a lot of different kind of values like an `href` of anchor tag `<a>`, value of `<input>` tag with `v-bind:<kind of bind variable>`. We can bind html in the page also with `v-html='varible-name-containing-html-text'`.

We access the variable (declared in data object) in the functions with **this**.*variableName*

## Events:

We listen to events with **v-on**:*event-name*. Like -

```
<button v-on:click="greet('Ashish')">Greet User</button>
``` 

## Event modifiers:

We can define several event modifiers on the events (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html#Event-Modifiers)

This is the list:

    .stop
    .prevent
    .capture
    .self
    .once
    .passive

We define the event modifiers like this:

**v-on**:*event-name*.***event_modifier***

Example: `v-on:click.once="greet('Ashish')"`

## Two way data binding:

Whenever we change a variable on HTML page we can reflect that value back in the variable declared in the `data: {}`. We do this with `v-model="variableName"`. `{{}}` only injects the variable as a value in HTML - once.

## Computed properties:


```
<div id="example">
  <p>Original message: "{{ message }}"</p>
  <p>Computed reversed message: "{{ reversedMessage }}"</p>
</div>
```
```
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#example',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello'
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    reversedMessage: function () {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```

Here we have declared a computed property `reversedMessage`. The function we provided will be used as the getter function for the property `vm.reversedMessage`:

```
console.log(vm.reversedMessage) // => 'olleH'
vm.message = 'Goodbye'
console.log(vm.reversedMessage) // => 'eybdooG'
```

You may have noticed we can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression:

```
<p>Reversed message: "{{ reverseMessage() }}"</p>
```
```
// in component
methods: {
  reverseMessage: function () {
    return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
  }
}
```

Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies. **A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed**. This means as long as message has not changed, multiple access to the `reversedMessage` computed property will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the function again.

This also means the following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive dependency:

```
computed: {
  now: function () {
    return Date.now()
  }
}
```

Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property A, which requires looping through a huge Array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on A. Without caching, we would be executing Aâ€™s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method instead.

## Binding CSS classes

We can bind the class to a variable with `v-bind:class="{<className1>:<true/false>, <className2>:<true/false>}"`. Here we can assign true or false direct to class name. But doing this, we can't change the class name on runtime. To do that, assign a variable to className like `className1:variableContainingClassNameString`. Now change the `variableContainingClassNameString` to `true` or `false` based on user action. `false` value will remove particular class and `true` will make the class active.

## Conditionals `v-if` and `v-show`

These tags are used to display and hide/remove the particular tag from HTML page.

`v-if` takes a boolean value. It true, the tag will be in the page, if false, then it'll be removed completely from the page's HTML tree.

```
<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
<h1 v-else-if="average">Angular is average!</h1>
<h1 v-else>Oh no ðŸ˜¢</h1>
```

`v-show` will set the display style property to true/none.

## v-for (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html)
We can iterate on an array right in the HTML page.

```
<ul id="example-1">
  <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.message">
    {{ item.message }}
  </li>
</ul>
```
```
var example1 = new Vue({
  el: '#example-1',
  data: {
    items: [
      { message: 'Foo' },
      { message: 'Bar' }
    ]
  }
})
```

`v-for` also supports an optional second argument for the index of the current item.

```
<ul id="example-2">
  <li v-for="(item, index) in items">
    {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
  </li>
</ul>
```
You can also use v-for to iterate through the properties of an object.
```
<ul id="v-for-object" class="demo">
  <li v-for="value in object">
    {{ value }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

*When iterating over an object, the order is based on the enumeration order of `Object.keys()`, which is not guaranteed to be consistent across JavaScript engine implementations.*

## Multiple Vue instances

Inside the app.js, we can define more than one instance - which can render in there respenctive `<div>` tags using the id assigned to the div and using that in el of instance. It's not advised to render mumltiple instance though.

## Vue component

We can declare a component in the app.js like this -

```
Vue.component('compName', {
  template: '<html section to be loaded in the component>'
})
```
Now we can render the component in the vue instance like this

```
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <compName></compName>
    </div>
  </body>
```
Component declared by `Vue.component()` is a global component and can be used in any instance.

------------------------------

The data object can be declared in the component
```
Vue.component('compName', {
  template: '<html section to be loaded in the component>',
  data: function() {

  }
})
```

data is defined as function so that data is local to one declaration of the component.

```
// Define a new component called button-counter
Vue.component('button-counter', {
  data: function () {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  template: '<button v-on:click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>'
})
```
Components can be reused as many times as you want:
```
<div id="components-demo">
  <button-counter></button-counter>
  <button-counter></button-counter>
  <button-counter></button-counter>
</div>
```
[**data** Must Be a Function](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#data-Must-Be-a-Function)

## Create project with vue/cli

Using the vue cli can setup a VUE.JS project. The project then can organize the project in component files (.vue files) with a single root component being used in the single vue instance.

First install node.js and then install vue-cli using **npm**
`npm install -g @vue/cli` // This is newer version's name

You can check you have the right version with this command:
`vue --version`

To upgrade the global Vue CLI package, you need to run:
`npm update -g @vue/cli`

To create a new project, run:
`vue create hello-world`

The new project created will have folders *node_modules* and *src* along with *.babelrc* *index.html*, *README.md* and *webpack.config.js*

These files are the bones of a vue application.

## Vue files and root component

Inside the *src* directory we've *assets* directory and JS files *App.vue* and *main.js*

*main.js* controls everything from the start. This file imports `App from App.vue`. This App is the root component which is used to create the **vue instance** and **render** on html page `index.html`.

We can render our root component in two ways (both are same):

```
new Vue(
  {
    el: '#app', //any html tab which can render the App
    render: h => h(App)
  }
)
```
Or,
```
new Vue({
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

## Vue Component Revisited
In the project created by vue-cli, the components are created in the .vue files (.vue is just convention).
In these files, the code is devided in three parts -
```
<template>
  <!-- The HTML part to be rendered -->
</template>

<script type="text/javascript">
  //imports here

  export default {
    components: {

    },

    data: function() {

    },

    methods: {

    },

    computed: {

    }
  }
</script>

<style type="text/css" scoped>
  
</style>
```

So a component:
- represents a part of whole webpage. 
- contains HTML, CSS and Javascript code to render the intended part

## Nesting a component in another component

We can nest one component in another by registering a component globally in `main.js` or importing in the parent component where we want to nest it.

Let's say we've `ninjas.vue`. It defines and exports a component.

**We can register the component globally in `main.js`:**

```
import Ninjas from './ninjas.vue'
Vue.component('ninjas', Ninjas) //first one is name we give it, seconds is object (which we export in .vue file)
```

Now we can render this in any component's template like this:

```
<template>
  <div> <!-- template should have a root HTML tag -->
    <ninjas></ninjas> <!-- component renders here. tag name is same as name given to it while registering -->
  </div>
</template>
```

**We can import the component locally in a target component:**

Now we can render this in targeted component's template like this:
```
<template>
  <div> <!-- template should have a root HTML tag -->
    <ninjas></ninjas> <!-- component renders here. tag name is same as name given to it while registering -->
  </div>
</template>

<script type="text/javascript">
  //imports here
  import Ninjas from './ninjas.vue';

  export default {
    components: {
      'ninjas' : Ninjas //Locally giving name to imported nested component. It's actually local registration.
    }
    data: function() {

    },

    methods: {

    },

    computed: {

    }
  }
</script>
```

## HTTP Requests with Vue

Vue itself doesn't provide support to do HTTP requests. We can install and import the plugin(s) to do that.
I am going to use [**VueResource**](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource). We can use jQuery or fetch api of JS/browsers also.

Install it:

```
npm install vue-resource --save
```
After installation, it'll be in `package.json`'s dependencies.

Import in `main.js`:

```
import VueResource from 'vue-resource'

Vue.use(VueResource); //Very important. Vue.use() makes the plugins available to be used.
```

Using the VueResource to make requests:
In the template:
```
<button v-on:click.prevent="pastForm()">Add Blog</button>
```
In the script-
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  export default {
    data: function() {
      blog: {
        title: "",
        content: ""
      },
      submitted: false
    },

    methods: {
      postForm: function() {
        this.$http.post('https://example.com/v1/api/add/blog', {
          title: this.blog.title,
          body: this.blog.content,
          userId: 1
        }).then(function(data) {
          console.log(data);
          this.submitted = true;
        })
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Routing with vue

Plugin to use : **vue-router**

Define a `routes.js` under the **/src**, and declare your routes.

```
import showBlogs from './components/showBlogs.vue';
import addBlogs from './components/addBlogs.vue';

export default [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: showBlog
  },

  {
    path: '/add',
    component: addBlog
  }
]
```

Now register these routes with router instance in `main.js`.

```
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import Routes from './routes'; //We defined the file above

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const myRouter = new VueRouter({
  routes: Routes
})

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: h => h(App),
  router: myRouter
})

```
